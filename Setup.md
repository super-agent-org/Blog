Now that both companies up and running, it's time to review the experience and decisions made when incorporating Super Agent.

# Intro

When starting Super Agent, a decision was made to create a C Corporation using Stripe Atlas and then a Portuguese Subsidiary.

# Why a C Corporation and not an LLC?

LLCs are pass-through entities. Their income is subject only to one level of tax, at the member level. This means you will be taxed at a personal level and that you also can pass-through any losses you may have to offset other income on your individual tax return.
If you are incorporating a startup, a C Corp is the way to go. Traditional Angel Investors and VCs prefer C Corps and most won't invest in LLCs. C Corps allow for an unlimited number of shareholders and make it easy to issue stock options and create employee equity plans. It is perfect for a company looking to go public. Delaware C Corps have a well-known, regulated, management structure.

# Why Delaware?

Not only Delaware state law is highly developed and favorable toward corporations, but also virtually all corporate lawyers in the US (and many across the world) are familiar with Delaware corporate law. This is because most of the state-corporate laws are usually influenced by Delaware Corporate Law.

As I mentioned above, Delaware C Corps have a well-known and very flexible management structure. This is great when it comes to structuring the board of directors, voting rights, and stock issuance and preferences. On top of that, it gives you the broadest privacy protections. For example, no need to reveal your director's name on the incorporation documents.

Lastly, Delaware works fast and they make it look easy. Fillings are quick to be stamped, and there doesn't seem to be tons of bureaucracy like in other states.

# Why Stripe Atlas?

We decided to go with Stripe Atlas because we were familiar with Stripe, and it seemed like the most straightforward solution. Looking back, I think that Clerky would have been the better choice. Still, the experience with Stripe Atlas was a positive one.
We waited until January 2021 to avoid having to pay tax in 2020. We created the account in Stripe Atlas and paid the 500$ fee on January 7th. On the 8th, we received the filed Certificate of Incorporation.
Creating the account was a very simple and painless process. I won't bore you with details.
The next step was issuing the Stock Purchase Agreements (SPAs). This is where we would do things differently.
If you have a simple setup where all Co-Founders will have the same vesting period (4-year vesting; 1-year cliff) and under 80% of equity, then Stripe Atlas works for you.
We hadn't. So we had to get some lawyers involved to customize our SPAs.
We contacted Lawbite (lawbite.co.uk) to draft the SPAs and the SAFE notes while they were at it. The guys at Lawbite were fantastic. Not only were they super clear, but they were also fast. Their platform makes the process very smooth despite the poor UX.
We paid $500 for the Stripe Atlas application and $1,176 for the Lawyers.
Clerky offers a lifetime package for $799. I can't be 100% sure that Clerky would have solved all our problems, but it seems more cost-effective while it would have also prevented us from using two different platforms.
